This projects was created during the 2013 HackPrinceton.
The entire project was created within a 48 hour period.
This was the first big project I did developing for the iPhone.
My group and I had the idea of a user taking a picture of something they draw on a piece of paper and the phone doing something with that image.
We were split between having the image be a UI for an app, which the user could than program the UI elements and load it into Xcode.
The other half of the app was a game I would design.
Halfway through the hackathon, my group members wanted to do a different project, but I continued to work on the game.
The project will not work anymore, because the server that analyzes the photos taken is no longer up.

The premise of the game evolved multiple times.  I settled on the idea that the game could be made up of many games.
The main mini game I worked on was like breakout, but the user drew symbols on the paper to represent different objects,
Sliding their finger on the screen, the user would control a paddle that would keep a ball bouncing with the object of
colliding with each object on the screen.  Friends could draw different arenas and see who could clear the board in the fewest amount
of bounces.  Another game concept that was never finished was drawing your own pinball level.  Because it was my first time doing
serious iPhone developement, I was learning as I coded, all within the time constraints of 48 hours.

Ben Cohen worked on the Python server using SimpleCV

Nate Burgers worked on taking the picture, sending the image to the server, and making the UI.
